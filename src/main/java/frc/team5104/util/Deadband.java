/**
 * <h1>Deadband</h1>
 * A deadband is a mathmatical process to stop input from the center of the joystick.
 * The xbox controller can get stuck slightly off of 0 causing the robot to move slowly on it's own
 * Most deadbands like WPI's and the TalonSRX's just clip off numbers < ~0.05.
 * This sometimes doesn't account for the range in which the joystick can get stuck and may prevent moving the robot a speeds like 0.05.
 * THIS CLASS uses a deadband system that basically, instead of clipping, pushes the values away.
 * A graph of "x" input, "y" output would be like so:
 *  \
 *   \
 *    -----
 *         \
 *          \
